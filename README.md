# Tetris Min-Max A.I. & Custom Simulation

Creating a simulation of tetris from scratch that is both playable by a user, as well as both of the AI's I developed

<br>

## Summary
 - Created an accurate and faithful Tetris simulation using Python and the Tkinter interface that is playable by the user while also easily and seemlessly interfacing with the AI
 - Goal was to create a basic single agent online AI that can clear several levels on average as well as score well before inevitably losing
 - Two different AIs were created, trained, and evaluated to examine if increased complexity in the AI is directly related to improved performance
 - Overall, both AIs functioned relatively well, but were wildly inconsistent - About 1 in 10 trials would result in the AI failing to even score a single point or it would score in the hundreds of thousands, clearing anywhere from levels 9-13
 - In the end, the less complex algorithm was faster with near identical performance
